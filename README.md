# Bnita
Bnita is an extension for Anita that adds support for additional virtual machine systems like GXemul,
You could treat it as the Beta version of Anita adding extra functionality
or, as a step up from the previous version, hence, A -> B
Also, Bnita (pronounced Bee-neeta) is my mom's name :)

# TODO:
1. Adding support for creating an instance of class Bnita in the anita script.
2. Adding support for running tests.
